This is a placeholder blog post. Replace it with your actual woodworking content.
Everything below demonstrates the markdown features available to you.

## Getting Started

Describe the project goals and materials here. You can use **bold** and _italic_ text,
or even [link to resources](https://example.com).

Materials list:

- 4/4 walnut boards
- Wood glue
- Danish oil finish
- Sandpaper (120, 180, 220 grit)

## The Build

Walk through the steps of the project. Use numbered lists for sequential steps:

1. Mill the lumber to rough dimensions
2. Joint and plane to final thickness
3. Cut joinery
4. Dry-fit and glue up
5. Sand through the grits

> Take your time with the glue-up. Rushing this step leads to misaligned joints
> that are difficult to fix later.

You can include inline images alongside your text:

## Final Thoughts

Reflect on the finished piece. What went well, what you'd do differently next time.
